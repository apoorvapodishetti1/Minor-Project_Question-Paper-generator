        <div className='about'>Our aim  is to  generate automated question papers for Universities/Engineering colleges without human effort.
          <li>Traditional exam paper creation requires coordination with government experts. The regular process of  preparing the question paper is, exam cell has to send a request for the question paper to the government experts and the experts will be sending the question paper in 15 days to 1 month time period. To reduce that effort we are providing this where you can get the question papers based on the previous year question papers designed by the experts.</li>
